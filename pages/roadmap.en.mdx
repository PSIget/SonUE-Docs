# Roadmap

To create a detailed roadmap for porting the STALKER trilogy to Unreal Engine 5, we will define key development stages, dividing them into priority categories: Foundation, Shadow of Chernobyl (SoC), and Call of Pripyat (CoP). This will organize the development process more efficiently and focus on the most important aspects of porting.

## 1. Foundation

These steps form the foundation of the port, ensuring compatibility and the possibility of further functionality extensions.

<Steps>

### Implementation of full cycle location development

Developing tools and methodologies for creating and adapting locations for Unreal Engine 5, including transferring textures, lighting, and basic objects. This will ensure visual consistency with the original game while improving graphics quality.

### Ability to port old content

Creating tools for efficient transfer of existing content, including models, textures, and gameplay elements from the original trilogy to Unreal Engine 5, while retaining their unique features.

### Kinematics System Support

Integration of X-Ray animations into Unreal Engine 5 to preserve mechanics and enhance quality, with the ability for reverse integration into X-Ray.

### Implementation of Attachments in Unreal Engine 5

Attachments from X-Ray Engine are now integrated into Unreal Engine 5 via Proxy to ensure compatibility and efficient interaction.

### Implementation of HUD Weapon Rendering

Implementation of first-person HUD weapon support in Unreal Engine, providing native integration and improved visualization quality.

### Create a tool for terrain transfer

Developing a tool for automatic conversion of terrain from X-Ray to the Unreal Engine 5 Landscape format, ensuring high accuracy of transfer and preservation of the original world's features.

</Steps>

## 2. Shadow of Chernobyl

These steps focus on recreating key elements and atmosphere of the first part of the trilogy.

<Steps>

### Implementation of weather

Adapting the dynamic weather system from Shadow of Chernobyl for Unreal Engine 5, achieving a new level of realism and immersion in the game world.

### Implementation of particles

Transferring the particle system responsible for anomalies, explosions, shots, and other visual effects, optimized for modern hardware and engine capabilities.

### Implementation of decals

Creating a decals system for realistic display of bullet marks, blood, and other elements, enhancing the visual component and atmosphere.

### Transfer of sounds to Unreal Engine 5

Integrating audio content from Shadow of Chernobyl, ensuring high-quality sound using the new capabilities of Unreal Engine 5's audio system.

### Post Process effects

Integrating and adjusting post-processing to achieve characteristic visual effects and atmosphere of the original trilogy, using modern technologies and capabilities of Unreal Engine 5.

### Implementation of Full Menu Functionality

Complete menu adaptation, including settings and loading screen, to ensure deep customization and enhanced user experience.

</Steps>

## 3. Call of Pripyat

Stages aimed at implementing features and improvements introduced in the last part of the trilogy.

<Steps>

### Implementation of a multithreaded animation system

Optimizing and adapting the animation system for multithreading use, significantly increasing performance and quality of animations.

### Implementation of development capabilities on Blueprint

Introducing support for programming in Blueprints for developing game mechanics and interactive elements, simplifying the development process and providing more flexibility.

### Physics Implementation on Unreal Engine 5

Optimization of the physics engine to increase realism of object interactions, eliminating the need for redundant metadata and simplifying the porting of Skeletal Mesh without Actor Editor.

### Implementation of 3D UI

Creating a three-dimensional user interface, improving player interaction and enriching the visual and gameplay experience.

</Steps>

### Additional Notes

#### Clear Sky

Including a full port of Clear Sky in our project is not planned due to significant resource and time constraints, as well as a number of technical and organizational difficulties. Nevertheless, we intend to explore possibilities for integrating certain elements and aspects of "Clear Sky" within our available resources. It should be understood that this endeavor is not mandatory, and we are making efforts to achieve this goal without prior guarantees.

This roadmap represents a comprehensive plan for porting the STALKER trilogy to Unreal Engine 5, taking into account current priorities and resources, as well as the desire to recreate the original gaming experience using modern technologies.
