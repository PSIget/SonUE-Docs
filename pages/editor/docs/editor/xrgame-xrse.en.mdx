# Reloading XrGame and XrSE_Factory

Reloading XrGame and XrSE_Factory is done with a single button.

***

If you need to reload, update the object list, or refresh the configurations, then this button is for you.
It completely reloads `system.ltx` and `game.ltx`.

It also reloads `se_factory`, including its scripts.
For XrGame, the scripts are reloaded every time you launch PIE (Play In Editor)!
