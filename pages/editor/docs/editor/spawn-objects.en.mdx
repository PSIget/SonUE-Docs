# How to Work with Spawn Objects

## Creating Spawn Objects

Creating and editing Spawn Objects is similar to the original GSC editor. In the "Place Actors" section, there is a separate list of objects that is automatically populated, just like in the original GSC SDK.

They also work through the SE\_Factory.

The properties are almost identical to the GSC spawn shape properties (Box, Sphere). They are added as components.

Their display can be disabled.

## Building Spawn for the Game

Unreal Editor also automatically marks that Level Spawn requires rebuilding.

The spawn building, like in GSC, is divided into two types:
1. LevelSpawn - Level spawn (can only be built on the respective level)
2. GameSpawn - Game spawn (built from level spawns as configured)

It can also be automatic if required for PIE (Play In Editor).

For PIE, there are GameSpawn build modes.

The configuration of the level list used for building GameSpawn is located in the project settings. Each game has its own list.

![...](./spawn-objects.ru/img/image27.png)

Here, the link to the level is configured, as well as the `Include In Build Spawn` option.

![...](./spawn-objects.ru/img/image28.png)

With `Include In Build Spawn` disabled and "Ignore `Include In Build Spawn`" enabled in PIE, the level will not be included in the list during automatic `Build full spawn`.

Manual triggering of the build is also possible.

Building GameSpawn from the toolbar or menu will build the entire GameSpawn entirely, ignoring `Include In Build Spawn` (i.e., all levels in the list for that game).

What the GameSpawn build log looks like.

For the proper building of GameSpawn, all the following conditions must be met:
1. At least one GraphPoint on each level.
2. Only one "actor" with the tag single\_player.
3. The level must have a built LevelSpawn and AIMap.

The built file looks the same as in the original:

If there is an error during spawn building, detailed information is provided in the log.
