# Building the Source Code

Currently, it is possible to build the project for the following platforms:

- Windows 10 20H2 64-bit and newer

In the future, it will be possible to build for all other platforms, including mobile devices.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Pay attention to the order. It is very important to first build the X-Ray Engine, and then the Unreal Engine!
</Callout>

## Cloning the Project

It is necessary to do this recursively using the `--recursive` parameter

```bash
git clone https://git.s2ue.org/RedProjects/SonUE --recursive
```

![Terminal](./build.ru/img/git-clone.png)

## Automatic Build

### 1. Running the Build Script

Run `build.bat` and wait for the build to successfully complete.

### 2. Launching the Project

After a successful build, the editor can be launched via the `{src}/Stalker.uproject` file

## Manual Build

### 1. Building the X-Ray Engine

X-Ray is located at the following path:

```path
{src}/Source/XRayEngine/Source/EngineSOC.sln
```

This project needs to be opened and compiled with the necessary [configuration](../install-and-build/configs).

#### Build Example

Building `DebugGame Editor` in the Unreal project. For this, I need to compile all solutions with the `Debug` configuration.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Everything as in [that](../install-and-build/configs) table, otherwise it will not launch!
</Callout>

### 2. Building the UE Project

#### 2.1. Creating a VS Project for UE Build

After successfully building the X-Ray Engine, return to the repository's root folder and generate the project.

**Note**

- If there are no "Generate Visual Studio project files" options, you can fix it by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZu5EB2UfiA).
- Before generating the project, to avoid errors during compilation, only keep the latest version of MSVC in the Visual Studio Installer

---

#### 2.2. Compiling Files for Launching the Unreal Engine Project

After generating the Visual Studio project, open it and select the necessary build configuration.

The generated file is located at `{src}/Stalker.sln`.

**Attention!!!** Select `Games / Stalker` in the project explorer and click "Build".

**Note**

- After the build, you can launch the editor, but you will not be able to play until you install the full content.
- You can find the latest content build for the last build in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/red-projects-530968529311367178) in the [#last-build](https://discord.com/channels/530968529311367178/1085389969675268196) channel.

### 3. Launching the Project

After a successful build, the editor can be launched either by the `Launch` button in VS or through the `{src}/Stalker.uproject` file
