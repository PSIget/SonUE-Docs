# Changing Game in Unreal Engine

## Preparation

First, make sure you don't have a level with a spawn loaded, as it can cause a crash. It is also recommended to create an empty level.

## Changing the Game and Reloading XrGame
Select the desired game and wait for the XrGame to reload.

* The spawn is automatically updated after changing the game.
