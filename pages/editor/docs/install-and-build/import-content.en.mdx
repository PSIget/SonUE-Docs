## Preparing Resources
If you decide to import content from **gamedata**, you first need to place the full version of **gamedata** and **rawdata** in the project's root folder.

### Table

| Game                                | gamedata Name | rawdata Name |
|-------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|
| S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl | gamedata_soc  | rawdata_soc  |
| S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky           | gamedata_cs   | rawdata_cs   |
| S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat     | gamedata      | rawdata      |

The table shows the folder names where you should place the resources depending on the desired game. The `rawdata` folder is located at `{src}/Source/XRayEngine`.

**Note**:
* Initially, the gamedata folders for all three parts are included in the git, but they only contain scripts and configs. DO NOT DELETE OR REPLACE THEM.
* The `rawdata` folder contains the source files for the X-Ray SDK content. You need to move the `levels` and `objects` folders into it.
* In the gamedata folder, you need to move everything else.

## Importing into Unreal Engine

After setting up the gamedata and rawdata folders, you need to perform a minimal import of the required content in the editor to run PIE (Play In Editor).

### Open the "Stalker" menu

![Import Content](./import-content.ru/img/import.png)

In order, execute the three import commands:
- Import UI Textures
- Import Physical Materials
- Import Meshes

After that, you can create a test location and run PIE.

**Note**:
The project allows importing the following formats in UE5:
- `.dds` (compressed)
- `.ogf`
- `.object`
- `.level` (XRay SDK)
- `.gamemtl.xr`
