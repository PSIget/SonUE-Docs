# Optimization Recommendations

For comfortable gaming in Full HD, it is recommended to use a video card not lower than **RTX 3060 Ti**.

## Changing Settings

If your hardware is weak, you can run the game in windowed mode instead of fullscreen or make changes in the settings file to improve performance:

```ini filename="{game}\Stalker\Saved\Config\Windows\GameUserSettings.ini" {5-7,10-12}
[ScalabilityGroups]
sg.ResolutionQuality=100
sg.ViewDistanceQuality=3
sg.AntiAliasingQuality=3
sg.ShadowQuality=3
sg.GlobalIlluminationQuality=3
sg.ReflectionQuality=3
sg.PostProcessQuality=3
sg.TextureQuality=3
sg.EffectsQuality=3
sg.FoliageQuality=3
sg.ShadingQuality=2
```

Replace the `3` with `2` or lower. This will help gain performance. Plus, you can also disable anti-aliasing (if your eyes are not like a baby's and do not hurt from the staircases). To do this, simply replace the `3` with `0` in the line `sg.AntiAliasingQuality=3`.
