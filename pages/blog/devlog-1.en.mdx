The first thing to understand is that this is not a release, it's another build, but now shipped with the editor.

## Editor release

Yes, you can already engage in your shenanigans, creating locations entirely in the engine's editor, including meshes, spawns, AI grids, and waypoints. Compilation of all this mess happens right in the editor.

Moreover, as promised, the editor includes maps from the entire trilogy. However, locations from Clear Sky and Call of Pripyat are in a raw state without processing, textures, just a raw import from the original.

An immediate question from the audience: "Can locations from other projects, like the Zone Reclamation Project, be imported?" Yes, they can. However, locations made for the original editor usually have large meshes baked into them. Because of this, when importing "as is," Lumen in Unreal Engine won't understand such tricks and won't be able to properly calculate and bake lighting. Lod models are also affected. When generating lods and attempting to generate Nanites, the model simply collapses into a point. It might collapse completely or partially. That's exactly why optimization hasn't been achieved yet.

### Possibilities for modders

The second question from the audience: "Can narrative modifications already be made?" Yes, they can - everything is done the same way as before. However, cutscenes, for example, can now be created directly in the editor. Everything else remains the same. So if the author or authors have a burning desire, they can start working on modifications right now. You can even comfortably port existing modifications if you want.

And yes, anticipating a likely question, I'll say it right away: you can import anything into the engine, even assets from Quixel - everything will work. As for the editor, that's all for now.

## Fixed bugs and build features

Now let's talk about the Shadows of Chernobyl game build. The first and most important thing is that the game is now launched not through a `.bat` file, but directly from the `.exe` file. So making a mistake is out of the question.

The entire game can now be played from start to finish - the entire storyline is in place. However, occasional crashes may occur due to GSC's hacks, which might have worked in the original X-Ray engine but produce some artifacts within Unreal Engine. However, despite this, the game is fully playable, and, more importantly, the save function works, which negates the crashes. The only thing is that the weather and time of day are still fixed, as restoring the day-night cycle with weather is not a priority task.

The menu now works completely, and yes, it's been redesigned - it's a whole separate scene. Looks nice, right? By the way, from the main menu, you can press the `N` key to access the spawn menu - the Zone Master Gold version 5, where you can conjure up anything you want as usual. But there's one catch. Level switching from under this menu is disabled. To jump between locations, use the console and the `xray.jump_to_level` command.

## Unpleasant features

Now let's talk about the less pleasant aspects. Firstly, it's still a dev build. This means that the performance will be on par with the previous build. I won't do anything about it for now.

Secondly, the system requirements haven't changed. To achieve a stable framerate of 60+ frames per second out of the box, you'll need a graphics card no lower than an RTX 3060 Ti, RTX 2070 Super, or an equivalent from AMD. If your hardware falls short, you can try tweaking the settings (this was mentioned in the previous blog post).

Thirdly, particles are not working yet. They work fine in the editor, but the following issues arise from this:

- Anomalies are not visible
- Poltergeists

...and other minor things

### Performance recommendations

For comfortable gameplay at Full HD resolution, a graphics card no lower than **RTX 3060 Ti** is recommended. If your hardware is weaker, you can run the game in windowed mode instead of fullscreen or make changes to the settings file to improve performance:

```ini filename="{game}\Stalker\Saved\Config\Windows\GameUserSettings.ini" {5-7,10-12}
[ScalabilityGroups]
sg.ResolutionQuality=100
sg.ViewDistanceQuality=3
sg.AntiAliasingQuality=3
sg.ShadowQuality=3
sg.GlobalIlluminationQuality=3
sg.ReflectionQuality=3
sg.PostProcessQuality=3
sg.TextureQuality=3
sg.EffectsQuality=3
sg.FoliageQuality=3
sg.ShadingQuality=2
```

Replace `3` with `2` in these lines. This will improve performance. Plus, you can disable anti-aliasing (if your eyes are not as sensitive as a baby's and don't get bothered by jagged edges). To do this, simply replace `sg.AntiAliasingQuality=3` with `sg.AntiAliasingQuality=0`.
