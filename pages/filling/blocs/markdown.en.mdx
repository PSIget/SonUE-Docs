# Markdown

## Basic Concepts

This information briefly summarizes the information from the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) website.

### Headings

To create a heading, add number signs `#` before the word or phrase. The number of number signs should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a third-level heading `<h3>`, use three number signs, for example, ### My Heading.

```md filename="Markdown"
# Heading level 1
## Heading level 2
### Heading level 3
#### Heading level 4
##### Heading level 5
###### Heading level 6
```

### Emphasis
You can add emphasis by making text bold or italic.

#### Bold
- `I just love **bold text**.` - I just love **bold text**.
- `I just love __bold text__.` - I just love __bold text__.
- `Love**is**bold` - Love**is**bold

#### Italic

- `Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.` - Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.
- `Italicized text is the _cat's meow_.` - Italicized text is the _cat's meow_.
- `A*cat*meow` - A*cat*meow

#### Bold and Italic

- `This text is ***really important***.` - This text is ***really important***.
- `This text is ___really important___.` - This text is ___really important___.
- `This text is __*really important*__.` - This text is __*really important*__.

### Blockquotes

```md filename="Markdown"
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
```

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

##### Blockquotes with multiple paragraphs

```md filename="Markdown"
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

##### Nested blockquotes

```md filename="Markdown"
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

##### Blockquotes with other elements

```md filename="Markdown"
> **The quarterly results look great!**
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
>  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.
```

> **The quarterly results look great!**
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
>  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.

### Lists
You can organize items into ordered and unordered lists.

```md filename="Markdown"
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item
```

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

```md filename="Markdown"
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
    1. Indented item
    2. Indented item
4. Fourth item
```

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
    1. Indented item
    2. Indented item
4. Fourth item

```md filename="Markdown"
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item
```

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

```md filename="Markdown"
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
    - Indented item
    - Indented item
- Fourth item
```

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
    - Indented item
    - Indented item
- Fourth item

```md filename="Markdown"
* This is the first list item.
* Here's the second list item.

    I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.

* And here's the third list item.
```

* This is the first list item.
* Here's the second list item.

    I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.

* And here's the third list item.

### Horizontal Rule

To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks `***`, dashes `---`, or underscores `___` on a separate line.

```md filename="Markdown"
***

---

_________________
```

The visual output of all three is the same:

---

### Links
To create a link, enclose the link text in square brackets (e.g., `[Duck Duck Go]`), and then immediately follow it with the URL in parentheses (e.g., `(https://duckduckgo.com)`).

```md filename="Markdown"
My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com "The best search engine for privacy").
```

The rendered output will look like this:

My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com "The best search engine for privacy").

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    You can also insert a plain URL without any formatting.
</Callout>

### Images
To add an image, use an exclamation mark `!`, followed by the alt text in brackets, and the path or URL of the image resource in parentheses. Optionally, you can add a title in quotes after the path or URL.

```md filename="Markdown"
![Placeholder!](https://placehold.co/832x400/ "Placeholder")
```

![Placeholder!](https://placehold.co/832x400/ "Placeholder")

## MDX

All your `.mdx` files located in the `pages` directory will be rendered using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/about) - an extended Markdown format with React components support.

For example, you can import and use React components inside Markdown files like this:

```mdx filename="Markdown"
## Hello, MDX

import { useState } from 'react'

export function Counter({ children }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      {children}
      {count}
    </button>
  )
}

<Counter>**Clicks**: </Counter>
```

It will be transformed into:

import Shadow from './markdown.ru/components/shadow'
import { useState } from 'react'

export function Counter({ children }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      {children}
      {count}
    </button>
  )
}

<div className="mt-6 rounded border border-gray-200 p-4 dark:border-gray-900">
  <Shadow mode="open">
    <h2>Hello, MDX</h2>
    <Counter>**Clicks**: </Counter>
  </Shadow>
</div>

In addition to basic MDX, the Documentation also incorporates some advanced Markdown features.

## GitHub Flavored Markdown

[GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm) is a Markdown extension created by GitHub that adds support for strikethrough, task lists, tables, and more.

### Strikethrough

~~deleted~~

```md filename="Markdown"
~~deleted~~
```

### Task Lists

- [x] Write press release
- [ ] Update website
- [ ] Contact media

```md filename="Markdown"
- [x] Write press release
- [ ] Update website
- [ ] Contact media
```

### Autolinks

Visit https://nextjs.org.

```md
Visit https://nextjs.org.
```

### Custom Heading ID

You can specify a custom heading ID using the format `## My Heading [#custom-id]`. For example:

```md filename="Markdown"
## Long Heading [#about]
```

In this example, `#about` will be used as the link to the heading, replacing the default `#long-heading`.

`import`

## Syntax Highlighting

We use [Shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io) for syntax highlighting during the build process. It is highly reliable and efficient. For example, adding the following code to your Markdown file:

````md filename="Markdown"
```js
console.log('hello, world')
```
````

Output:

```js
console.log('hello, world')
```

### Features

#### Inline Code

Inline syntax highlighting is also supported, for example `let x = 1{:jsx}`, using the syntax `{:}`:

```md filename="Markdown"
Inlined syntax highlighting is also supported `let x = 1{:jsx}` via:
```

#### Line Highlighting

You can highlight specific lines of code by adding the `{}` attribute to the code block:

````md filename="Markdown"
```js {1,4-5}
import { useState } from 'react'

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>
}
```
````

Output:

```js {1,4-5}
import { useState } from 'react'

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>
}
```

#### Substring Highlighting

You can highlight specific substrings within the code block by adding `//` attribute:

````md filename="Markdown"
```js /useState/
import { useState } from 'react'

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>
}
```
````

Output:

```js /useState/
import { useState } from 'react'

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>
}
```

You can highlight only certain occurrences of that substring by adding a number to it: `/str/1` or multiple: `/str/1-3`, `/str/1,3`.

#### Copy Button

Adding the `copy` attribute will add a copy button to the code block when the user hovers over it:

````md filename="Markdown"
```js copy
console.log('hello, world')
```
````

Output:

```js copy
console.log('hello, world')
```

#### Line Numbers

You can add line numbers to code blocks by adding the `showLineNumbers` attribute:

````md filename="Markdown"
```js showLineNumbers
import { useState } from 'react'

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>
}
```
````

Output:

```js showLineNumbers
import { useState } from 'react'

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>
}
```

#### File Names and Headers

You can add a file name or header to code blocks by adding the `filename` attribute:

````md filename="Markdown"
```js filename="example.js"
console.log('hello, world')
```
````

Output:

```js filename="example.js"
console.log('hello, world')
```

#### ANSI Highlighting

You can highlight ANSI escape codes:

````md filename="Markdown"
```ansi
[0m [0;32m✓[0m [0;2msrc/[0mindex[0;2m.test.ts (1)[0m

```
````

Output:

```ansi

```

### Supported Languages

Check [this list](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/main/docs/languages.md) for all the supported languages.

### With Dynamic Content

Since syntax highlighting is done during the build process, you cannot use dynamic content within code blocks. However, since MDX is very powerful, there is a workaround using client-side JavaScript. For example:

import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react'

export function DynamicCode({ children }) {
  const ref = useRef()
  const tokenRef = useRef()
  // Find the corresponding token from the DOM
  useEffect(() => {
    if (ref.current) {
      const token = [...ref.current.querySelectorAll('code span')].find(
        el => el.innerText === '1'
      )
      tokenRef.current = token
    }
  }, [])
  return (
    <>
      <div ref={ref} style={{ marginTop: '1.5rem' }}>
        {children}
      </div>
      <a
        onClick={() => {
          tokenRef.current.innerText =
            (parseInt(tokenRef.current.innerText) || 0) + 1
        }}
        style={{
          cursor: 'pointer',
          userSelect: 'none'
        }}
      >
        Increase the number
      </a>
      <a
        onClick={() => {
          tokenRef.current.innerText = '1 + 1'
        }}
        style={{
          marginLeft: '.5rem',
          cursor: 'pointer',
          userSelect: 'none'
        }}
      >
        Change to `1 + 1`
      </a>
    </>
  )
}

<DynamicCode>
```js filename="dynamic_code.js"
function hello () {
  const x = 2 + 3
  console.log(1)
}
```
</DynamicCode>

This workaround has a limitation: updated content will not be highlighted again. For example, if we update the number to `1 + 1`, it will not be correctly highlighted.
